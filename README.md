💼 Real-Time Job Analytics Portal
📘 Overview
The Real-Time Job Analytics Portal is an interactive data visualization tool designed to analyze job market trends using real-time filters and conditions. Unlike traditional static job boards, this portal incorporates dynamic filtering, geolocation insights, and time-sensitive visualizations to help both job seekers and recruiters make well-informed, data-driven decisions.

Built using Tableau and hosted via Netlify, the dashboard leverages job-related attributes such as job title, company size, qualifications, work type, gender preference, salary, and location to reveal deeper insights into recruitment dynamics across regions and timeframes.
